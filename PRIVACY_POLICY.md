# Privacy Policy for Azkar Drive

**Effective Date:** February 2, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Azkar Drive**. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand what information involves your device.

## 2. Information We Collect and How We Use It

### 2.1 Microphone Usage (Audio Recording Permission)
**Azkar Drive** requires access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`) for the sole purpose of enabling the **"Smart Tracking"** feature.

*   **How it works:** The app uses speech recognition technology to listen to your recitation of Azkar (supplications) while you are driving. This allows the app to automatically increment counters without you needing to touch the screen, promoting safer driving habits.
*   **Data Processing:** All audio processing is performed **locally on your device**.
*   **No Storage or Transmission:** We **do not** record, save, store, or transmit your voice or audio data to any external servers, third parties, or cloud storage. The audio data is processed in real-time to detect specific phrases and is immediately discarded.

### 2.2 Device Information
We may collect non-personal information about your device, such as the model, operating system version, and general usage statistics (e.g., app crashes), to help us improve the app's performance and stability.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Since we do not collect personal audio data or identifiable user information, we do not share, sell, or disclose your personal data to third parties.

## 4. Security
We prioritize the security of your data. By processing sensitive data like audio input entirely locally on your device, we eliminate the risks associated with transmitting voice data over the internet.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
